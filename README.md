## 🎯 Why This Works

- **Built from real frustration**: Danial is *very* passionate about automation—not because it’s fancy, but because he’s **too lazy to do repetitive, error-prone tasks** over and over. If a computer can do it once, it should do it forever!
- **Rooted in real hiring experience**: Hidayah doesn’t just “review resumes”—she’s been on the other side of the table, making hiring decisions, and knows exactly what makes a candidate stand out.
- **No theory—just doing**: Every session solves a real pain point (e.g., “I rename 50 files every Monday” or “My resume gets ignored”).
- **Free + paid tiers**: Start with a **free trial workshop**, then unlock full access.
- **Designed for busy professionals**: Short, focused sessions you can apply **immediately**.
