## 🎯 Why This Works

- **We solve real pain points**: Fahim automates tasks because he’s *too lazy* (and too error-prone!) to do boring, repetitive work manually. If it can be automated once, it should run forever.
- **No fluff, just results**: Every exercise mirrors actual office scenarios—like updating daily sales files or cleaning HR data.
- **Beginner-first design**: No prior experience? Perfect. We start from “What is a variable?” and end with “I built this myself.”
- **Free entry point**: Try Day 1 of any tech workshop at no cost—no signup needed.
